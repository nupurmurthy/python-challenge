# Arrays

Arrays are multiple instances of a type in a series.

Examples:
```python
States = ["NY", "NJ", "PA"]
```

In VBA we define arrays similarly to how we define variables:
```vb
'Method 1 : Using Dim
Dim arr1()	'Without Size

'Method 2 : Mentioning the Size
Dim arr2(5)  'Declared with size of 5

'Method 3 : using 'Array' Parameter
Dim arr3
arr3 = Array("apple","Orange","Grapes")
```

The above code was shamelessly stolen from [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vba/vba_arrays)
