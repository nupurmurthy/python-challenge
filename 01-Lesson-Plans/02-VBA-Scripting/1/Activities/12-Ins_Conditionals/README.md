# Conditionals 

Just like in regular Excel, VBA allows for conditionals. Conditionals are essentially functions that return Boolean values (True, False)


## Operators
 - = denotes equality
 - <> denotes inequality
 - > denotes greater-than
 - < denotes less than
 - >= denotes greater-than-or-equal-to
 - <= denotes less-than-or-equal-to

## If statements
If statements allow for branching logic

```vb
If <condition> Then
    ...
Elseif <condition> Then
    ...
Else
    ...
End If
```
