# Students

There are two assignments in this group:

## Assignment 1: Modulo

Here we learn the Modulo operator. Modulo gives the remainder when dividing by a given divisor. The syntax is:
```vb
<number> Mod <divisor>
```

ie:
`4 Mod 2` will return 0

For this assignment, solve the following equations and assign the results to a value in the table
```vb
    4 Mod 2
    5 Mod 4
    11 Mod 8
    23 Mod 7
    24 Mod 19
    -1 Mod 2
    10 Mod -2 
```

## Assignment 2 Conditional for Loops

In the first 10 row, write in the first Column whether it is an `even row` or an `odd row`. The above excercise is a hint.
