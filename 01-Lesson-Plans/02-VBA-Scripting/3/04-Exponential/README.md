# Fibonacci
The fibonnaci sequence is defined by f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) with f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1


## Part 1
Allow the cell in row 2 column 1 to be filled in. When it does, every row below it should populate with 1 less than that value but stop at negative numbers.

That is if I fill in a 5 in that Cell, I should get

```
5
4
3
2
1
0
```

## Part 2 Excel
In the second column, solve fibonacci using only built in excel functions


## Part 3 Sub Routines
In the third Column, solve the fibonacci sequence using a subroutine.


## Part 4 Functions
In the 4th column, Write an Excel function that takes in a number n and returns the nth fibonacci number


## Part 5 Equation
In the 5th column, Solve fibonacci using Binets formula http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinetsFibonacciNumberFormula.html


## Part 6 
In the 6th column, show the ratio of F(n) to F(n-1)
