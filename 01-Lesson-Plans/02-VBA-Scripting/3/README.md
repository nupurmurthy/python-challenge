# Week 2 - VBA Scipting, Day 3

For this class, we will be applying more structure. The reason for this is to try to students at different levels.

## Lesson Structure

There will be a series of lessons in a class. Each lesson will consist of a series of: activity, live coding, lecture. A lesson should take about 45 min, and an expected timeline


 - Activities - there will be a series. Ideally they will fill a gradient of easier to more difficult. The order may not necessarily follow difficulty. Order will represent priorities. This

 - Live Coding - I will start to go through the activities. Initially, this will be slowly, to nudge students along.That is, activities will gradually turn into live coding. Initially, these will be small steps, but as the lesson goes further along, I the pace will pick up. The goal here is to catch up to students and spend some time explaining anything that would have led students to be stuck. For really important details, I will gather everyone's attention, but the purpose of this section is to let students move at a pace they are comfortable with so feel free to continue working if you are. 

 - Lectures - Lectures will focus on either new topics or advanced topics. Lecture


 ## For this specfic class
 We will have 5 lessons:
 - 10:00 - Nested For Loops
 - 10:40 - Sorting
 - 11:20 - Functions
 - 12:00 - Imperative vs. Declarative
 - 12:40 - Lunch
 -  1:20 - Stochastic Systems

 40min is should be broken into 5 parts
 - start activity
 - slow live coding hints
 - live coding solution
 - lecture
 - buffer

The last two are the advanced topics.
Lunch can be swapped for 12:15
